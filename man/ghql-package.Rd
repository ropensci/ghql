The main interface in this package is [GraphqlClient], which produces
a client (R6 class) with various methods for interacting with a
GraphQL server. [GraphqlClient] also accepts various input parameters
to set a base URL, and any headers required, which is usually the required
set of things needed to connect to a GraphQL service.

[Query] is an interface to creating GraphQL queries,
which works together with [GraphqlClient]
